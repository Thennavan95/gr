# Gradient Descent Example
This is forked from *mattnedrich's* [GradientDescentExample](https://github.com/mattnedrich/GradientDescentExample) Repository

## Description 
This example project demonstrates how [Gradient Descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) algorithm can solve [Linear Regression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) problems

## Usage
To run this code, open *GradientDescent.py* file using any Python 3 interpreter. Make sure 'data.csv' is in same path

to use this in your projects,
* import this class in your code
* create object for this class
* call *train_model* method with x &  y axis as numpy arrays
* you can call *predect* method with any x value(s) & it'll return it's corresponding y value(s)
* *variable_set* is a tuple that contains intercept, slope & error values

### Suggestions
feel free to fork & update to your needs. lets make world a better place with open source
